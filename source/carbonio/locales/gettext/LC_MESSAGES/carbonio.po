msgid ""
"The distinction between forwarding and redirecting emails lies in their "
"intended purpose and outcome. When you forward an email, you are "
"essentially sending a copy of the original message to another recipient, "
"allowing them to view the content and any attachments included in the "
"forwarded message. This is useful for sharing information with someone "
"who may not have been included in the original email thread. On the other"
" hand, redirecting an email involves sending the original message to a "
"different recipient without creating a copy. Instead, the email is "
"rerouted to the new recipient's inbox as if it were originally addressed "
"to them. This is typically done for administrative purposes or to ensure "
"that important communications reach the appropriate recipient directly."
msgstr ""

"Therefore, opting to redirect a message instead of forwarding it "
"simplifies the process for the recipient to reply directly to the "
"original sender."
