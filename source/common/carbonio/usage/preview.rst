*Carbonio Preview* allows to have a quick look at those files.
Supported files that can be previewed include PDFs, text documents,
spreadsheets and other office files, and images, but excluding the
**svg** format.

To preview a supported file, click **once** the name of the file: the
*Details* view will open. Here, click the small magnifier icon above
the details to show an automatic preview in JPG format, centred and
scaled to the browser's window size. PDF files can be scrolled with
buttons (``PgUp``, ``PgDown``, ``Home``, ``End``)

On |file|, to open a file for editing, it is necessary to right-click
the file name, then selecting **Open Document** from the drop-down
menu.

Once a document is opened in preview mode, different actions can be
carried out: to share, download, or print it.

Depending on the browser used and its settings, the print action may
start immediately or a print dialog will be shown.
