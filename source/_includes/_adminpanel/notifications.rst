The `Notification` tab allows to see all notifications that have been
sent by |carbonio| about its status. By default, all notifications are
shown; clicking the tabs above the top-right of the list will show
only notification marked as `Information`, `Warning`, and `Errors`, in
increasing order of severity.

When a notification is selected, its status (read or unread) can be
toggled and its whole content can be copied as a text message.
