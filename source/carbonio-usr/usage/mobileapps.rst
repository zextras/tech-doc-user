Mobile APPs Configuration
-------------------------

In order to access from a |zx| mobile app to your account, please
follow the directions in this section. The procedure is required only
when you configure the first APP, all the other will be able to reuse
the credentials configured for the first App: in other words, the
access credentials are shared among |zx| Apps.

For example, if you install the |carbonio| Mail App and configure to
access the account ``john@example.com``, as soon as you install the
|file| App, you will be able to automatically access the files stored
in |file| for the same account.

In the remainder, we configure the |carbonio| Mail App, but the
directions are the same for other Apps.

Server Side Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mobile application is enabled by default on all users.
These are the only server-side requirements:

* Port 443/HTTPS must accessible from the Internet

* A valid SSL/TLS certificate must be available for the domain


* The user with whom you log in via the |product| Mail App must be
  existing and active

.. _carb-mail-login:

   .. grid-item::
      :columns: 3



.. _carb-mail-auth:

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|carbonio| Mail mobile app connects to the server through an HTTPS
secure connection and |carbonio| responds with its certificate.  This
process (called SSL handshake) provides data integrity and data
privacy to the information transferred between the client and the
server, which is encrypted, provided that the SSL certificate is
**active and not expired**.

.. _carb-mail-notifications:

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Android devices manufacturers have strict default settings on which
apps can display notifications, sometimes causing the |carbonio| Mail
App not to be able to notify new messages.

To make sure that your device allows all required notifications, follow these steps:

#. Log out from the app

#. Access the device’s Settings, then enter the **Apps &
   Notifications** menu

#. Select the |carbonio| Mail app from the list of all installed apps

#. Enter the **Notifications** section

#. Enable the notifications (first option on the top)

#. Enable the banner notification on the **Appointment** and **E-mail**
   subsections

#. Log back in

Notifications should now work!

.. warning:: For push notifications to work on the device, the
   |product| server must be able to communicate with the
   notifications.zextras.com service on port 443 (The exact URL to
   which notifications are sent is:
   https://notifications.zextras.com/firebase/ )
