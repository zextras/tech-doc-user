   The top bar of |product|, used to search for objects and to create
   new ones.

In |product|, the functionalities to create new objects (email,
contacts, calendar appointments and events, and so on) and to search
have been integrated into the top bar. For example, it is possible to
create a new calendar appointment while reading e-mails or search for
contacts when planning an event on calendar.

To do so, use |product|'s top bar, shown in
:numref:`fig_top_bar`. Click the blue |new| button to create a new
object in the module you are currently in (i.e., while in the
calendar, create a new appointment) or the
:octicon:`chevron-down;1em;sd-bg-primary sd-text-white` to create a
new object in another module.

The search works in a similar way: the white button on the right-hand
side of the |new| button, which changes label depending on the current
module, can be used to search in the module the string provided in the
text box. Click the :octicon:`chevron-down;1em;sd-bg-light
sd-text-black` to search in a different module. A more advanced search
is available in the :ref:`Advanced search module <search-comp>`.
