Composing a New Email
----------------------

To compose and send a new email message, follow these steps:

#. Tap **Compose** (pen icon) to open a new message.
#. If multiple sending identities or personas are available, select the appropriate one from the **From** field.
#. In the **To** field, enter one or more recipient email addresses.
#. Optionally, add additional recipients in the **Cc** or **Bcc** fields.
#. Enter a subject in the **Subject** field.
#. Write the message content in the email body.

While editing the message, additional options are available:

- Use the **formatting toolbar** to customize the text appearance. You can:
  
  - Select a text style such as **Title**, **Subtitle**, or **Body text**.
  - Change the text color.
  - Apply text formatting options, including **bold**, *italic*, underline, and other supported styles.

- Tap the **Attachment** (paperclip) icon to:
  
  - Take a photo and attach it to the message.
  - Select one or more images from the device gallery.
  - Choose a document from the device storage.
  - Add files from **Carbonio Files**, if available.

- Tap the **More options** (three-dot) icon to:
  
  - Save the message as a draft.
  - Schedule the message for delivery by selecting a date, time, and time zone.
  - Set the message priority.
  - Request a read receipt from the recipient.

#. When finished, tap **Send** (paper-plane icon) to send the message.

After the message is sent, a copy of the email is automatically saved in the **Sent** folder.


Replying to an Email
----------------------

To reply to an email message, follow these steps:

#. Open the email you want to respond to.
#. Tap **More options** (three-dot icon).
#. Select **Reply** to respond to the sender only, or **Reply all** to respond to all recipients.
#. Write your message.
#. Tap **Send** (paper-plane icon) to send the reply.

While replying, the same editing, formatting, attachment, and message options available when composing a new email can be used. For more information, see :ref:`composing-a-new-email`.

A copy of the sent reply is automatically saved in the **Sent** folder.


Reply vs. Reply All
----------------------

The difference between **Reply** and **Reply all** is the recipients of your response:

* **Reply** sends your response only to the original sender.
* **Reply all** sends your response to the sender and to other recipients from the original email (typically added automatically in Cc).

Use **Reply all** only when your response is relevant to everyone included in the original conversation.

Actions on Multiple Emails at Once
------------------------------------

To perform actions on multiple emails:

#. Tap and hold an email to enter **selection mode**.
#. Tap other emails to select them.
#. Tap **More options** (three-dots icon) or the available action buttons.
#. Choose the action you want (for example: mark as read/unread, flag, move, mark as spam, tag, delete).

Adding Attachments
-------------------

While composing an email, you can attach files from your device, from Carbonio Files, or capture a photo/video (if supported).

Add an attachment from your device
------------------------------------

#. Tap **Attach** (paperclip icon).
#. Choose an option such as **Take photo/video**, **Choose from gallery**, or **Browse/Document**.
#. Select the file (or capture it) and confirm.

Add an attachment from Carbonio Files
--------------------------------------

#. Tap **Attach** (paperclip icon).
#. Select **Add from Files / Drive** (wording may vary).
#. Choose the file and confirm.

.. note::

   Attachments are a common way viruses spread. Administrators may block certain file types
   (for example ``.exe`` or ``.zip``). In some cases you may not receive a warning if the
   recipient’s system blocks the attachment—so consider confirming receipt when it’s important.

Send an Email from a Different Account or Persona
--------------------------------------------------

If you have multiple identities/personas configured, you can choose which one to use when composing:

#. In the compose screen, tap the **From** field.
#. Select the desired **identity/persona**.

The recipient will see the selected identity/persona as the sender.

Request a Read Receipt
----------------------

If available, you can request a read receipt:

#. While composing, open **More options** (three-dots icon).
#. Enable **Read receipt**.
#. Close the menu and send the email.

Save an Email as a Draft
-------------------------

To save a draft while composing:

#. Open **More options** (three-dots icon).
#. Select **Save draft** (or simply exit the compose screen if the app autosaves drafts).

Send a Drafted Email
----------------------

#. Open the app menu (typically the menu icon).
#. Go to the **Drafts** folder.
#. Open the draft you want to send.
#. Tap **Send**.

Forwarding an Email
-------------------

To forward an email:

#. Open the email.
#. Tap **More options** (three-dots icon).
#. Select **Forward** (or **Forward conversation**, if shown).
#. Enter the recipient and tap **Send**.

Redirecting an Email
----------------------

To redirect an email (if available):

#. Open the email.
#. Tap **More options** (three-dots icon).
#. Select **Redirect**.
#. Enter the recipient and tap **Send**.

Forward vs. Redirect
----------------------

* **Forward** sends a copy of the message to someone else (often allowing you to add your own text).
* **Redirect** reroutes the original message to a new recipient as if it had been sent to them originally,
  making it easier for the new recipient to reply directly to the original sender.
