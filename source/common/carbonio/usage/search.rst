The Search module vastly improves the search capabilities of the
:ref:`quick search <global-search>` top bar. Click the
:bdg-primary-line:`ADVANCED FILTER` button to open a dialog that will
help you refine the search criteria on all your e-mails.

You can combine multiple search criteria, some of which are inclusive
or exclusive (i.e., you can search for e-mails with or without
attachments, that are flagged or not, and that are read or unread),
while other allow to provide values for almost any other property of
an e-mail, including  sender or recipient, subject or keywords, type of
attachment, and limit the search according to a period of time or to a
size interval.

Moreover, you can search on tags given to the e-mail and limit the
search to specific folders. When all criteria have been entered, click
|search| to start the search, while clicking |reset| will clear the
dialog.

In the resulting list of result, click any e-mail to open it. To
further refine the search, click the blue bar above the list of
e-mails. The dialog will reopen, with the same criteria entered
before: here you can add more constraints or change some of them.
