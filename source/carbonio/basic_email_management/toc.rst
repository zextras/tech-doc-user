Using Folders
=============

Folders serve to arrange both incoming and outgoing email correspondence. You have the option to create your folders or utilize predefined system folders:

**System folders** - These folders are immutable; they cannot be relocated, renamed, or erased. The system includes the following folders:

•	**Inbox**: The primary destination for new incoming email messages.
•	**Sent**: Contains a copy of all outgoing emails.
•	**Drafts**: Emails you have composed but not yet sent.
•	**Junk**: Incoming emails suspected to be spam or junk, although not definitively, are directed here. You can sift through these messages, moving or deleting them as necessary. If left untouched, they are automatically purged according to the administrator's settings.
•	**Trash**: Deleted items are relocated here and remain until you manually empty the trash or until automated purging occurs.

**User-defined folders**: These folders, which you create to structure your email, appear in the Folder list within the Overview pane. It is important to note that top-level folder names must be unique and cannot match any other top-level folder within your inbox.
