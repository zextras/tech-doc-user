Many services are available to configure individually. For each of
them it is possible to **Disable 2FA** completely, allowing user access
with username and password only; to **Trust the IP**, meaning that all
client connections from a given IP address or IP range will be trusted even
if they don't use 2FA; and to **Trust the device** which allows an
application (usually a browser) to be trusted when connecting from a
given IP.

.. hint:: 2FA applies only to those protocols or apps supporting it,
   for example HTTP and HTTPS but not to IMAP and SMTP.
