|Docs| is based on a heavily customised LibreOffice online package
that adds to |product| ability for all persons in the organisation to
collaborate in editing different types of documents, including text
documents, word processors, spreadsheets, and presentations.

The integration of |docs| with items stored in |file| and with email
attachments is seamless and handled by a dedicated |docs| component.

Whenever one wants to edit a document, a connection to a |docs| server
instance starts, a copy of the file is retrieved and rendered in the
user's browser. When changes are made, only changes to the client are
sent back, in order to keep the accuracy and fidelity of the document
between client and server, while at the same time reducing the
bandwidth use to the bare minimum.

Every document can be shown in either a read-only mode, with a
simplified |gui| limited to the viewing functionalities, or in edit
(read/write) mode with a full |gui|.
