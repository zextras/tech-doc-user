|mesh| is required to allow communication between |product| and its
components. The configuration is interactively generated by command

.. code:: console

   # service-discover setup-wizard

This command will:

* ask for the IP address and netmask

* ask for the |mesh| :ref:`secret <mesh-credentials>`, which is used for
  setups, management, and to access the administration GUI. See
  section :ref:`mesh-gui` for more information.

  This password will be denoted as |meshsec| throughout the
  documentation.
  
  .. include:: /_includes/hint-pwd.rst

  In case the password is lost or the credential file becomes
  corrupted and unusable, you can reset them using the procedure
  detailed in section :ref:`mesh-reset-single`.

* store the setup in file
  :file:`/etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg`

To complete |mesh| installation, run

.. code:: console

   # pending-setups -a

.. hint:: The **secret** needed to run the above command is stored in
   file :file:`/var/lib/service-discover/password`, which is accessible
   only by the ``root`` user.
