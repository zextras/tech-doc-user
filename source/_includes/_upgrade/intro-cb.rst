|product| does not have any installer: whenever new versions are
released, the |zx| repositories are updated and packages are available
for installation along with the other system updates. Therefore, the
upgrade procedure is usually a very quick activity, carried out 
by means of a few commands to be executed on each **Node**.

The upgrade procedure consists of a preliminary task, followed by the
proper upgrade, which is the same for each **Node**. Regardless of the
version currently installed, the successful upgrade will always bring
|product| to the latest version available, currently |version|.

Depending on the packages upgraded, and the version from which you are
upgrading, some manual step may be required. Please read carefully
section :ref:`upgrade-checklist` **before starting the upgrade**, to
see if you need to carry out some additional task.

.. note:: Only the **three previous versions** are supported for
   upgrade. If you install from an older version, you may need to
   execute further tasks to ensure proper functioning  of |product|.
   

Moreover, incompatibilities may arise in case the upgrade includes
third-party software, which may lead to some additional manual steps
to be carried out. Section :ref:`upgrade-ts` below
contains information to prevent or fix these issues.
