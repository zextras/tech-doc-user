 Working with Appointments 
==========================

Appointments serve as pivotal tools for organizing schedules, enabling the creation of both one-time and recurring events, meetings, and engagements. 

This feature facilitates efficient planning by allowing users to check the availability of attendees before extending invitations, reserve necessary resources such as meeting rooms and equipment, and append personalized messages to invitations. 

Such features enhance communication and coordination, fostering a productive work environment where employees can effectively manage their time and collaborate seamlessly.

To create a new appointment:

#.	Select the **Calendars** from your left sidebar.
#.	Click on the **NEW** button located on the top bar. A new board will appear.
#.	In the **From** field, select the identity you want to use to schedule and send the appointment invitation.
#.	Enter a title for the appointment in the **Event title** field.
#.	Specify a location for the appointment to occur in the **Location field**. If applicable, you may include details such as Room Number 2.
#.	Choose a meeting room from the available options in the **Meeting room** field. Please note that these meeting rooms are configured by your system administrator. If you do not see the desired room listed, kindly contact your system administrator to ensure all relevant meeting rooms in your office are included.	
#.	Choose the required equipment from the available options under the **Equipment field**. Please note that the equipment is configured by your system administrator. If you do not see the desired equipment listed, kindly contact your system administrator to ensure all relevant equipment such as cameras, displays, etc. in your office are included.
#.	If you prefer to host a virtual meeting using |product| Chats' video meeting feature in one of your virtual rooms, you can select the desired virtual room from the **Virtual Room field**. If you have not set up any virtual rooms yet, you can easily create them through the Chats section on the |product| web client.
#.	Enter the email addresses of the attendees into the **Attendees field**. You can leave this field empty if you are creating a personal appointment for yourself.
#.	Choose whether you would like |product| to mark this time slot for the appointment as busy or free from the **Display field**. This will inform your colleagues of your availability when they attempt to schedule another appointment during the same time slot.
#.	Choose the calendar in which you want to create the appointment from the **Calendar field**.
#.	Tick the **Private checkbox** if you wish to conceal the details of this appointment, such as its title, from your colleagues. Even if you have shared your calendar with them, your colleagues will still see the appointment listed on your calendar, but without the specific details like the title.
#.	Choose the time slot for the appointment by specifying the start date and time in the **Start date and time field**, and the end date and time in the **End date and time field**. Alternatively, you can tick the checkbox labeled **All day** if the appointment spans the entire day.
#.	Choose a reminder for the appointment from the **Reminder field** to ensure you are informed beforehand. |product| will display a warning window in the |product| client at the specified time to remind you of the appointment.
#.   Tick the **repeat** recurrence of the appointment if you want to use any of the pre-defined recurrences (every day, week, month, or year) or define a custom one, that may end after a date or a number of occurrences.
#.   Choose the time zone, if different from the default one. You need to enable this option in the Calendar's module settings, in *Creating Appointment* Section.
#.	Add any notes about this appointment in the text box.
#.	If you are creating the appointment solely for yourself, click **SAVE**. If your appointment includes attendees, as specified in step 8, click **SEND** to notify them via an automatic email.

Checking on attendees' availability with organizer tool
=======================================================

When scheduling a new meeting, with expected other attendees, you will also have the option to check on other attendees availability by simply opening the **organizer tool**.
Once you open the editor to create the appointment, after selecting all participants (both mandatory and optional), simply scroll down and click the “Show organizer tool” button.
A new section will open, displaying a timeline chart for the selected time range, showing the availability of each participant in the meeting. This will make it easier to select the most convenient time for everyone. This section is particularly useful when there are many participants, eliminating the need to check each individual calendar before choosing the time.
